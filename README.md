Refering CardGrid.tsx, Card.tsx and ExpandedCard.tsx

After putting in a lot of time writing a custom cardgrid with a modal, I found out that Chakra UI has a built in component for this.

I understand that it's important to learn how to build things from scratch, but I also think it's important to know when to use a library.

However, I did learn a lot about how to use React Hook Form and how to use TypeScript with it. That's why I'm keeping the custom cardgrid and modal.
